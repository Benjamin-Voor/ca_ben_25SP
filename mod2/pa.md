## Programmer-visible state
 
- **Registers**: 
  - Y86-64 has 15 general-purpose 64-bit registers, 
  - with `%rsp` serving as the stack pointer for function calls and stack operations.  
- **Condition Codes**: 
  - Three single-bit flags `(ZF, SF, OF)` indicate features of results of the most recent arithmetic or logical operation.  
- **Memory & Addressing**: 
  - Programs use `virtual addresses`, 
  - which are translated by hardware and the OS into physical memory locations.  
- **Program Status (Stat)**: 
  - Indicates execution state, detecting errors like invalid memory access or exceptions.  

| **15 Register** | **Encoding Identifier** | **Purpose** |  
|-------------|----|------------| 
| %rax        | 0 | General-purpose |  
| %rcx        | 1 | General-purpose |  
| %rdx        | 2 | General-purpose |  
| %rbx        | 3 | General-purpose |  
| %rsp        | 4 | Stack pointer (used by push, pop, call, return) |  
| %rbp        | 5 | General-purpose |  
| %rsi        | 6 | General-purpose |  
| %rdi        | 7 | General-purpose |  
| %r8 - %r14  | 8-E | General-purpose |  

| **3 Condition Code** | **Meaning** |  
|-------------------|------------|  
| ZF (Zero Flag)   | Set if the result of an operation is zero |  
| SF (Sign Flag)   | Set if the result is negative |  
| OF (Overflow Flag) | Set if an arithmetic operation causes an overflow |  

| **Program Counter** | **Purpose** |  
|----------|------------|  
| PC| Holds the address of the currently executing instruction |

## [Y86-64 instructions](https://github.com/YuanjieZhao/Y86-Disassembler/blob/release/Y86-64%20Instruction%20Set%20Architecture.pdf)

Y86-64 is a simplified x86-64 subset with only 8-byte integer operations and fewer addressing modes and instructions.

- **Data Transfer Instructions:** 
  - Y86-64 splits `movq` into `irmovq`, `rrmovq`, `mrmovq`, and `rmmovq`, 
  - explicitly defining source and destination types. 
  - Memory references use a base and displacement format.  
- **Integer Operations:** 
  - Includes `addq`, `subq`, `andq`, and `xorq`, 
  - operating only on registers and updating condition codes (`ZF`, `SF`, `OF`).  
- **Jump Instructions: `jXX`** 
  - Seven conditional jumps (`jmp`, `jle`, `jl`, `je`, `jne`, `jge`, `jg`) follow x86-64 branch conditions.  
- **Conditional Moves: `cmovXX`** 
  - Six conditional move instructions (`cmovle`, `cmovl`, `cmove`, `cmovne`, `cmovge`, `cmovg`) update registers based on condition codes.  
- **Function Calls:** 
  - `call` pushes the return address and jumps, while `ret` restores it.  
- **Stack Operations:** 
  - `pushq` and `popq` work the same as in x86-64.  
- **Halt Instruction:** 
  - `halt` stops execution with a status code of `HLT`, similar to x86-64‚Äôs `hlt`.

## Y86-64 instruction encoding II

- Y86-64 instructions are encoded in 1 to 10 bytes, 
  - depending on the required fields, 
  - with an `initial byte` identifying the instruction type.
- The initial byte is split into a high-order nibble "code" and low-order nibble "function" part, 
  - with codes ranging from 0 to 0xB. 
  - Function values are used for related instructions sharing the same code.

| Operations | Branches | Moves |
|---|---|---|
| `addq` 6 0 | `jmp` 7 0 `jne` 7 4 | `rrmovq` 2 0 `cmovne` 2 4 |
| `subq` 6 1 | `jle` 7 1 `jge` 7 5 | `cmovle` 2 1 `cmovge` 2 5 |
| `andq` 6 2 | `jl`  7 2 `jg`  7 6 | `cmovl`  2 2 `cmovg`  2 6 |
| `xorq` 6 3 | `je`  7 3 | `cmove`  2 3 |

- Each program register has a unique identifier (ID) from 0 to 0xE, 
  - with ID 0xF indicating no register access.
- Instructions may require additional register specifiers (rA, rB) for operands, 
  - depending on the instruction type, 
  - with specific values for single or no register operand instructions.
- Some instructions include an 8-byte constant word for immediate data, displacement, or branch/call destinations, 
  - with absolute addressing used for simplicity instead of PC-relative addressing.
- The byte encoding for each instruction must have a unique interpretation, ensuring unambiguous execution. 
  - Disassemblers may face issues if the starting position of the instruction sequence is unknown.
