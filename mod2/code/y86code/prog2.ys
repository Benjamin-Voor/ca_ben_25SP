# prog2: Pad with 2 nop's
#  Let us the program registers initially all have value 0.
# Pipelined execution of prog2 without special pipeline control. 
# The write to program register %rax does not occur until the start of cycle 7, 
# and so the addq instruction gets the incorrect value 
# for this register in the decode stage
