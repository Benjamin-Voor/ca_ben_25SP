# prog4: No padding
#  Let us the program registers initially all have value 0.
#  Pipelined execution of prog4 without special pipeline control. 
# In cycle 4, the addq instruction reads its source operands from the register file. 
# The pending write to register %rdx is still in the memory stage, 
# and the new value for register %rax is just being computed in the execute stage. 
# Both operands valA and valB get incorrect values.
