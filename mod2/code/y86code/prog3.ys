# prog3: Pad with 1 nop
#  Let us the program registers initially all have value 0.
# Pipelined execution of prog3 without special pipeline control. 
# In cycle 5, the addq instruction reads its source operands from the register file. 
# The pending write to register %rdx is still in the write-back stage, 
# and the pending write to register %rax is still in the memory stage. 
# Both operands valA and valB get incorrect values.
