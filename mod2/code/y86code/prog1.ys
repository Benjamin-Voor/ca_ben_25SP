# prog1: Pad with 3 nop's
#  Let us the program registers initially all have value 0.
#  Pipelined execution of prog1 without special pipeline control. 
# In cycle 6, the second irmovq writes its result to program register %rax. 
# The addq instruction reads its source operands in cycle 7, 
# so it gets correct values for both %rdx and %rax.
