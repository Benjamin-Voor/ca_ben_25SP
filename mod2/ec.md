# Exceptional control flow
CS:APP3e.ch08

## Overview

- **Control Flow & Transfers**  
   - The processor executes `a sequence of instructions (control flow)`, 
     - with `transitions` between addresses (control transfers).  
   - Smooth flow is interrupted by `jumps, calls, and returns`, 
     - while `exceptional control flow (ECF)` handles abrupt changes due to external events.  
- **ECF Across System Levels**  
   - **Hardware**: Triggers exceptions (e.g., `interrupts`, `timer events`).  
   - **OS**: Manages `context switches` between processes and system calls (traps).  
   - **Applications**: Uses signals, nonlocal jumps (`setjmp`/`longjmp`), and software exceptions (`try`/`catch`).  
- **ECF Enables `OS-Application Interaction`**  
   - `System calls` allow programs to request OS services
     - e.g., I/O, process creation.  
   - `Signals and interrupts` enable `responses to external events`
     - e.g., child process termination, network packets.  
- **ECF Supports `Concurrency & Error Handling`**  
   - Enables overlapping execution (e.g., threads, interrupts).  
   - Facilitates error recovery via exceptions and nonlocal jumps.  
- **Why ECF Matters**  
   - Key to understanding processes, I/O, and virtual memory.  
   - Essential for building systems software (e.g., shells, servers) and `handling real-world events` efficiently.

# Exceptions

- Exceptions are `abrupt control flow changes` implemented jointly by `hardware (detection) and OS (handling)` in response to processor state changes.
  - `Event triggers` can be 
    - instruction-related (arithmetic overflow, page fault) 
    - or external (timer interrupt, I/O completion), detected during execution.
  - Processor `routes control via exception table` to specific `OS subroutines (handlers)` that process each event type.
  - Handlers may retry current instruction, resume next instruction, terminate program  
    - depending on event type.

---

## Exception Handling

- **Hardware detects, software handles**  
   - CPU triggers exceptions via numbered events, OS provides handlers in exception table  
   - Kernel-mode execution with full privileges  
- **State saved automatically**  
   - Processor pushes context (registers, return address) to kernel stack  
   - Clean restoration via special return instruction  
- **Three resolution paths**  
   - Retry current instruction (e.g., page fault)  
   - Resume next instruction (e.g., interrupt)  
   - Terminate process (e.g., segmentation fault)  
- **Unified system interface**  
   - Handles both hardware faults and software traps (e.g., system calls)  
   - Secure user/kernel transitions with context isolation

## Classes of Exceptions

| Class| Cause  | Async/Sync | Return Behavior  |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|
| Interrupt | Signal from I/O device| Async | Always returns to next|
|   | |    | instruction   |
| Trap | Intentional exception | Sync  | Always returns to next|
|   | (e.g., system calls)   |    | instruction   |
| Fault| Potentially recoverable error  | Sync  | Might return to current  |
|   | (e.g., page fault)|    | instruction   |
| Abort| Nonrecoverable error   | Sync  | Never returns |

- **Interrupts (Asynchronous)**  
  - External hardware-triggered (I/O devices, timers)  
  - Always resumes next instruction after handling  
  - Uses dedicated interrupt pins and bus signals  
- **Traps (Intentional Synchronous)**  
  - Deliberate exceptions for system calls (e.g., syscall instructions)  
  - Enables controlled user-to-kernel mode transitions  
  - Returns to next instruction after service completion  
- **Faults (Recoverable Synchronous)**  
  - Correctable execution errors (e.g., page faults, protection violations)  
  - Handler may fix and retry faulting instruction or escalate to abort  
  - Critical for virtual memory and protection mechanisms  
- **Aborts (Fatal Synchronous)**  
  - Unrecoverable hardware/software failures (e.g., parity errors)  
  - Terminates offending process immediately  
  - Kernel handles cleanup without return  
- **System-Wide Exception Architecture**  
  - Unified numbering (0-255) covering CPU/OS-defined cases  
  - All classes use exception table for handler dispatch  
  - Hardware/OS collaboration enables secure control transfers  
  - Synchronous (instruction-linked) vs. async (external) distinction fundamental to design

## Exceptions in Linux/x86-64 Systems

- **CPU vs. OS Exception Types**  
   - **0-31**: Hardware-defined (faults/aborts like divide error, page fault, machine check)  
   - **32-255**: OS-defined (interrupts/traps including system calls)  
   - Critical faults trigger termination (e.g., #13 GPF ‚Üí "Segmentation fault")  
- **Recoverable vs. Fatal Exceptions**  
   - **Faults** (e.g., #14 page fault): Kernel fixes issue and retries instruction  
   - **Aborts** (e.g., #18 machine check): Unrecoverable ‚Üí process termination  
   - **Traps**: Intentional (e.g., syscalls) ‚Üí always resume next instruction  
- **System Call Mechanism**  
   - Invoked via `syscall` instruction with:  
     - `%rax` = call number (e.g., 1=write, 60=exit)  
     - Args in `%rdi`, `%rsi`, `%rdx` (up to 6 registers)  
   - Returns result in `%rax`; negative values indicate errors  
- **User/Kernel Transition**  
   - Syscalls switch to kernel mode automatically  
   - C wrappers (e.g., `write()`) simplify invocation  
   - Assembly example:  
     ```asm
     movq $1, %rax  ; write() syscall
     movq $1, %rdi  ; stdout
     syscall
     ```
- **Unified Exception Handling**  
   - All exceptions use jump tables (CPU exception table + OS syscall table)  
   - Hardware saves state before handler execution  
   - Sync (traps/faults) vs. async (interrupts) determine resumption behavior

# Processes

- Processes are `instance of executing program` with private state (memory, registers, files)  
- **Execution Context**  
   - Maintains code/data/stack segments, register states, and kernel structures  
   - `User-space (application code)` and `kernel-space (OS services)` memory separation  
- **Privilege Hierarchy**  
   - Dual-mode operation: user mode (restricted) vs kernel mode (full access)  
   - System calls (traps) enable controlled transitions to kernel mode
- **Kernel Interfaces**  
   - System calls provide controlled access to OS services  
   - /proc filesystem exposes kernel data to user space 
- **Address Space Protection**  
   - Each process gets isolated virtual address space  
   - Hardware prevents unauthorized memory access between processes 
- **Context Switching**  
   - Scheduler saves/restores process state (registers, PC, memory maps)  
   - Triggered by system calls, interrupts, or scheduler timeouts   
- **Scheduling Triggers**  
   - Voluntary: Process blocks on I/O or sleep()  
   - Involuntary: Timer interrupts force preemption  
- **Concurrency Mechanisms**  
   - Processes run `concurrently` via rapid `context switching`  
   - `Parallelism` achieved when processes run on `multiple cores`  
- **Performance Tradeoffs**  
    - Context switches enable multitasking but incur overhead  
    - Protection mechanisms add security at cost of complexity

# System Call Error Handling

- **Error Reporting Mechanism**  
   - Unix system calls return `-1` on failure and set `errno` to indicate specific errors  
   - Proper error checking is essential but often omitted for brevity  
- **Basic Error Handling**  
   - Manual checks require verbose conditionals and `strerror(errno)` for error messages  
   - Example:  
     ```c
     if ((pid = fork()) < 0) { 
         fprintf(stderr, "fork error: %s\n", strerror(errno)); 
         exit(0); 
     }
     ```
- **Simplification with Helper Functions**  
   - Wrappers like `unix_error()` consolidate error reporting and termination:  
     ```c
     if ((pid = fork()) < 0) 
         unix_error("fork error");
     ```
- **Stevens-Style Wrappers**  
   - Capitalized wrappers (e.g., `Fork()`) automate error checking:  
     ```c
     pid_t Fork(void) {
         pid_t pid;
         if ((pid = fork()) < 0) 
             unix_error("Fork error");
         return pid;
     }
     ```
   - Usage becomes concise: `pid = Fork();`
- **Design Philosophy**  
   - Wrappers maintain code clarity while enforcing error checking  
   - Base system calls (e.g., `fork`) are referenced in text, but wrappers (e.g., `Fork`) are used in examples

# Process Control

- **Process Lifecycle & States**
   - Created via `fork()` (copies parent's memory/descriptors, returns 0 in child/PID in parent)  
   - States: Running, Stopped (signals), Terminated (exit/signal/return)  
   - Zombies (unreaped terminated processes) persist until collected via `waitpid()` by their parents 
   - Orphans adopted by init process (PID 1)  
- **Program Execution & Environment**
   - `execve()` replaces process image (loads new program, preserves PID)  
   - Inherits: Open files, environment vars (`getenv`/`setenv`), working directory  
   - Argument passing via `argv[]` (program name + args) and `envp[]` (name=value pairs)  
   - Shells combine `fork()`+`execve()` (+ `waitpid()` for foreground jobs)  
- **Process Control & Synchronization**
   - `waitpid()` with options (WNOHANG/WUNTRACED) for flexible child monitoring  
   - Status macros decode termination (WIFEXITED, WTERMSIG, etc.)  
   - `sleep()`/`pause()` for timed waits or signal suspension  
   - Concurrent execution requires explicit synchronization to avoid races  
- **Isolation & Resource Management**
   - Private virtual address spaces (copy-on-write optimization)  
   - Process groups for shell job control (foreground/background)  
   - System resource limits (max PIDs, CPU/memory) enforced by kernel  
   - Security context (UID/GID) inherited unless SUID/SGID set  
- **Error Handling & Signals**
   - System calls return -1/`errno` on failure (e.g., ECHILD for no children)  
   - Signals (SIGSTOP/SIGCONT/SIGTERM) for interrupts/process control  
   - Default signal handlers can be overridden  
   - Critical for robust programs (especially servers/shells)

# Signals

- **Core Signal Mechanics**
  - Software interrupts delivering 30+ event types (SIGINT, SIGSEGV, etc.)
  - Generated by kernel (hardware exceptions) or processes (kill/alarm)
  - Immediate delivery to target process(es) or groups, with pending state tracking
- **Handler Implementation**
  - Customizable responses via signal()/sigaction() (except SIGKILL/STOP)
  - Async execution requires reentrant code and protected shared state
  - Critical safety rules: minimal logic, only async-safe functions, errno preservation
- **Process Control Patterns**
  - SIGCHLD for child monitoring with waitpid() synchronization
  - SIGALRM for timeouts and scheduled operations
  - Job control via SIGTSTP/SIGCONT for shell management
  - Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM vs SIGKILL)
- **Concurrency Challenges**
  - Race conditions from non-queued signals and async delivery
  - Atomic operation requirements for global variables
  - Safe synchronization using sigprocmask() and sigsuspend()
  - System call interruption handling (EINTR recovery)
- **Modern Best Practices**
  - Prefer sigaction() over signal() for portability
  - Replace signal-driven designs with event loops where possible
  - Use dedicated signal threads in complex applications
  - Implement fallback timeouts for signal-based waits
  - Audit handlers for security vulnerabilities

# Nonlocal jumps

- **Core Mechanism**
  - `setjmp` saves execution context (registers/stack) in a `jmp_buf` buffer
  - `longjmp` restores saved context, resuming from original `setjmp` call
  - Enables direct jumps across function stack frames without normal unwinding
- **Key Characteristics**
  - `setjmp` returns twice: initially (0) and after each `longjmp` (nonzero)
  - `longjmp` never returns, bypassing intermediate function cleanup
  - Requires careful variable handling (only `volatile` vars preserved)
- **Primary Use Cases**
  - Emergency exits from deep call stacks (error handling)
  - Signal handler recovery (using `sigsetjmp`/`siglongjmp` variants)
  - Implementing custom control flow (e.g., soft restarts)
- **Critical Considerations**
  - Potential memory leaks (skipped cleanup code)
  - Thread-unsafe (single jmp_buf per execution context)
  - Restricted usage in signal handlers (async-safety concerns)
- **Best Practices**
  - Initialize jump buffers before signal handler installation
  - Mark modified variables as `volatile`
  - Prefer modern alternatives (exceptions, state machines) where possible
  - Limit to well-defined error recovery paths
  - Avoid in complex multi-threaded applications
