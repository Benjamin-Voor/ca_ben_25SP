## Information Storage
- Computers access memory in **bytes (8 bits)** rather than individual bits, 
  - with each byte identified by a unique **address** in virtual memory.  
- **Virtual address space** is a conceptual view presented to programs, 
  - created by combining DRAM, flash memory, disk storage, hardware, and OS software.  
- Memory is partitioned by the compiler and runtime system 
  - to store **program data, instructions, and control information** within the virtual address space.  
- Pointers in C represent the **virtual address of a memory block**, 
  - with type information managed by the compiler, 
  - while `machine-level code` views all data as `byte sequences`.

## Hexadecimal Notation
- A byte (8 bits) ranges from **0 to 255 (decimal)** or **00 to FF (hexadecimal)**, 
  - with hex providing a concise way to represent bit patterns.  
- In C, **hexadecimal numbers** start with `0x` or `0X` and can use uppercase or lowercase 
  - e.g., `0xFA1D37B` or `0xfa1d37b`.  
- Converting between **binary and hex** is simple, done digit by digit, 
  - often using charts or memorized values for key hex digits.
- üìù Find the mappings between binary, octal, decimal, and hex
  ```python
  # Print table headers
  print(f"{'Decimal':<10}{'Binary':<10}{'Octal':<10}{'Hexadecimal':<10}")
  print("-" * 40)

  # Print values from 0 to 15
  for i in range(16):
      print(f"{i:<10}{bin(i)[2:].zfill(4):<10}{oct(i)[2:]:<10}{hex(i)[2:].upper():<10}")
  ```

| Decimal  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12| 13| 14| 15|
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Data Sizes
- Word size determines the maximum virtual address space, 
  - 32-bit machines having a 4GB limit 
  - 64-bit machines supporting up to 16 exabytes.
- 64-bit machines can run both 32-bit and 64-bit programs, 
  - depending on how the program is compiled.
- C language supports multiple data formats and sizes for integers and floating-point types, 
  - integer types available in signed and unsigned variants.
- Programmers should use fixed-size types like `int32_t` and `int64_t` for portability, 
  - ensure programs handle differences in data type sizes across platforms.

## Example Data Representations

| Data Type | char | short | int | long | float | double | long double | pointer |
|----|------|-------|-----|------|-------|-----|----|-----|
| Typical 32-bit| 1| 2 | 4   | 4| 4 | 8  | ‚àí   | 4   |
| Typical 64-bit| 1| 2 | 4   | 8| 4 | 8  | ‚àí   | 8   |
| x86-64| 1| 2 | 4   | 8| 4 | 8  | 10/16  | 8   |

## Addressing and Byte Ordering

- Multi-byte objects have a memory address given by the `smallest byte's address`  with bytes stored contiguously in two byte ordering
  - `little-endian` (`least` significant byte first), typically used by Intel-compatible machines
  - `big-endian` (`most` significant byte first), typically used by IBM/Oracle machines
  - some processors are bi-endian, such as ARM

- `0x12345678` memory layout

| Address      | 0x100 | 0x101 | 0x102 | 0x103 |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Little-Endian| 0x78  | 0x56  | 0x34  | 0x12  |
| Big-Endian   | 0x12  | 0x34  | 0x56  | 0x78  |


- Byte ordering is crucial in 
  - low-level programming for data transfer between machines with different endianness, 
  - integer representation in machine-level code

---

## üìù Practice: Endianness Conversion
- ‚ûä In Python
  ```python
  import struct
  import binascii

  little_endian = struct.pack('<I', 0x12345678)
  big_endian = struct.pack('>I', 0x12345678)
  hex_little = binascii.hexlify(little_endian).decode()
  hex_big = binascii.hexlify(big_endian).decode()
  print(f'big_endian:{hex_big}, little_endian:{hex_little}')
  ```

- ‚ûã In C, [showmem.c](./code/showmem.c)
  ```bash
  # compile the source code
  gcc showmem -o showmem

  # show typical types
  ./showmem  21930 short
  ./showmem  305419896 int
  ./showmem 1311768465155175236 "long long"
  ./showmem 0x1122334455667788 pointer

  ./showmem 3.14 float
  ./showmem 3.14 double
  ./showmem 3.14 "long double"
  ```

## Representing Text
- `Strings in C` are arrays of characters terminated by a null byte (0), 
  - typically encoded in `ASCII`, 
  - ensuring platform independence for text data,
  - limited for encoding non-Latin scripts. 
- `Unicode`, with over 100,000 characters, provides a comprehensive standard supporting global languages.  
  - includes ancient scripts but rejected fictional scripts like Klingon from Star Trek.  
- `UTF-8` encoding allows compatibility with ASCII, 
  - using 1 byte for common characters and more for rarer ones, 
  - ensuring efficient text representation.

---

## Unicode Encoding
| Encoding  | Description  | Byte Length<br>per character  | Compatibility| Use Case |
|---|---|------|---|----|
| **UTF-8** | Variable-length encoding    | 1 to 4 bytes | Backward compatible with ASCII | Web, text files, most common encoding|
| **UTF-16**| Variable-length encoding    | 2 or 4 bytes | Compatible with UCS-2| Windows, Java, used for internal processing|
| **UTF-32**| Fixed-length encoding  | 4 bytes | Direct mapping to Unicode code points  | Rare, used in specialized applications    |

## Review: C/C++ bit-level operations
- Bitwise operations are commonly used in low-level programming, embedded systems, and performance optimization.

| Operator | Name | Description | Example   |
|---|----|-----|---|
| `&` | Bitwise AND| Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1  | `a & b`   |
| `\|` | Bitwise OR | Sets each bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1 | `a \| b`   |
| `^` | Bitwise XOR| Sets each bit to 1 if only one bit is 1| `a ^ b`   |
| `~` | Bitwise NOT (complement)  | Inverts all bits  | `~a` |
| `<<`| Left shift | Shifts bits to the left, filling with 0s    | `a << 2`  |
| `>>`| Right shift (logical)| Shifts bits to the right, filling with 0s (unsigned)  | `a >> 2`  |
| `>>`| Right shift (arithmetic)  | Shifts bits to the right, preserving sign bit (signed)| `b >> 2` (negative b)  |

## Integer Binary Representations
- Given n-bits, $b_i$ as the bit at position $i$. The two popular integer encodings

| | Unsigned Representation | Signed Two's Complement Representation |
|---|---|---|
| Formula | $U = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_i \cdot 2^i$ | $S = -b_{n-1} \cdot 2^{n-1} + \sum_{i=0}^{n-2} b_i \cdot 2^i$  |
| Range | 0 to $2^n - 1$ | $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1} - 1$ |

- **Unsigned values** are always non-negative 
- **Signed two's complement** can represent negative values by utilizing the MSB as a sign bit
  - provide a simple way to represent negative numbers and perform subtraction with addition
- **Overflow** occurs if the result falls outside of range
- üìù Practice: find the ranges of C/C++ integer types

---

## Two's Complement and Radix Complement
- The **two's complement** system is a specific case of **radix complement** for base-2 (binary) numbers.
- In general:
  - **Radix complement** for base-$r$ and $n$-digit number $N$ is:  
    $r^n - N$
  - **Diminished radix complement** (one less than the full complement):  
    $(r^n - 1) - N$
- In **binary (base-2)**: $2^n - N$
- **Steps to compute two‚Äôs complement**:
  1. **Find the one's complement** (diminished radix complement):  $(2^n - 1) - N$  
     - This inverts all bits (flip 1 to 0 and 0 to 1).     
  2. **Add 1** to get the full radix complement: $2^n - N = (2^n - 1 - N) + 1$

## Arithmetic Operations on Unsigned Numbers
- Let $A$ and $B$ be two unsigned $n$-bit integers,

| Operation | Formula | Overflow Condition | Overflowed Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Addition | $S = A + B$ | If $S > 2^n - 1$, an **overflow** occurs, <br>vand the result wraps around (modulo $2^n$) | $S_{\text{result}} = (A + B) \bmod 2^n$ <br>‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Carry out** occurs if: $C = \left\lfloor \dfrac{A + B}{2^n} \right\rfloor$ |
| Subtraction | $D = A - B$ | If $A < B$, **borrow** occurs | $D_{\text{result}} = (A - B + 2^n) \bmod 2^n$ |
| Multiplication | $P = A \times B$ | ‚ñ∂Ô∏èThe product $P$ can be up to $2n$ bits long: $0 \leq P \leq (2^n - 1)^2$ <br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èThe lower $n$ bits are retained as the result, <br>and the upper $n$ bits represent overflow | $P_{\text{lower}} = P \bmod 2^n$ <br>$P_{\text{upper}} = \left\lfloor \dfrac{P}{2^n} \right\rfloor$ |
| Division | $Q = \left\lfloor \dfrac{A}{B} \right\rfloor$ | Division by zero is undefined | The remainder is: $R = A \bmod B$ |
| Modulo | $R = A \bmod B$ | No overflow | It ensures: $0 \leq R < B$ |
| Negation | $R = -A$ | $\text{Overflow if:} \quad (A ‚â† 0)$ | $R = -A \bmod 2^n$ |

- Unsigned arithmetic is straightforward but limited by the bit-width.  
- Overflow and carry detection is crucial in low-level programming.  
- Wrap-around behavior simplifies modular arithmetic.
- üìù [un.c](./code/un.c) shows arithmetic operations on `unsigned char` in C.
  - Extend it to other C unsigned integer types.

## Arithmetic Operations on Signed Two‚Äôs Complement Numbers
- Two‚Äôs complement representation in $n$-bits for $N$: 
  - $-2^{n-1} \leq N \leq 2^{n-1} - 1$
  - same as unsigned for **positive numbers**
  - $N_{\text{negative}} = 2^n - N$ for **negative numbers**
- Let $A$ and $B$ be two $n$-bit signed integers:

| Operation | Formula | Overflow Condition | Overflowed Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Addition | $S = A + B$ | $\text{Overflow if:} \quad (A_{n-1} = B_{n-1}) \land (S_{n-1} \neq A_{n-1})$  | $S_{\text{result}} = S \bmod 2^n$ |
| Subtraction | $D = A - B = A + (-B)$ | $\text{Overflow if:} \quad (A_{n-1} \neq B_{n-1}) \land (S_{n-1} \neq A_{n-1})$ | $D_{\text{result}} = D \bmod 2^n$ |
| Multiplication | $P = A \times B$ | $\text{Overflow if:} \quad P \geq 2^{n-1} \text{ or } P < -2^{n-1}$  | $P_{\text{result}} = P \bmod 2^n$ |
| Division | $Q = \left\lfloor \dfrac{A}{B} \right\rfloor$ | ‚ñ∂Ô∏èDivision by zero is undefined <br>‚ñ∂Ô∏è$\text{Overflow if:} \quad (A = -2^{n-1}) \land (B = -1)$  | $Q = (-2^{n-1}) \bmod 2^n = -2^{n-1}$ |
| Modulo | $R = A \bmod B$ | No overflow | ‚ñ∂Ô∏èIt ensures: $0 \leq R < B$ <br>‚ñ∂Ô∏è$R$ has sign of $A$ |
| Negation | $R = -A$ | $\text{Overflow if:} \quad (A = -2^{n-1})$ | $R = (-2^{n-1}) \bmod 2^n = -2^{n-1}$ |

- Overflow leads to wrapping around to the opposite end of the number line.  
- For $n$-bit numbers:  
  - Positive overflow results in a large negative value.  
  - Negative overflow results in a large positive value.
- üìù [sign.c](./code/sign.c) shows arithmetic operations on `signed char` in C.
  - Extend it to other C signed integer types.

## Multiplication and Division by Powers of 2 

| **Operation** | **Unsigned Integer** | **Signed Integer (Two's Complement)**| **Equivalent Bit Shift** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Multiplication by $2^k$** | $x \times 2^k$  | $x \times 2^k$ (Arithmetic shift left)| $x \ll k$ |
| **Overflow (Multiplication)** | Wraps around (mod $2^n$)    | Sign bit may change (overflow if sign changes)|  |
| **Division by $2^k$**  | $\lfloor x / 2^k \rfloor$ | $\lfloor x / 2^k \rfloor$ (Arithmetic shift right)  | $x \gg k$ |
| **Rounding (Division)**  | Always rounds down  | Rounds towards negative infinity    |  |
| **Sign Extension (Right Shift)**   | Zeros filled in left bits| Sign bit (MSB) extends (preserves sign)  | $x \gg k$ (with sign extension)    |
| **Overflow (Division)**  | No overflow    | No overflow (sign extension prevents it) |  |
| **Example (8-bit, $k=1$)**  | $1001_{(2)} \rightarrow 0100_{(2)}$ | $-3_{(10)} = 11111101_{(2)} \rightarrow 11111110_{(2)}$ | $x \ll 1$ or $x \gg 1$    |

## Multiplication and Division by K
- Multiplication
  - Express $K$ in binary: $K = b_n 2^n + b_{n-1} 2^{n-1} + \dots + b_1 2^1 + b_0 2^0$ 
  - Generate code using shifts and additions: $x \cdot K = \sum (x \ll i) \text{ for each } b_i = 1$

    ```python
    def multiply_by_constant(x, K):
        result = 0
        shift = 0
        while K > 0:
            if K & 1:  # Check if the least significant bit is 1
                result += (x << shift)  # Add shifted x
            K = K >> 1  # Shift K to the right (binary division by 2)
            shift += 1
        return result
    ```
- Division
  - Approximate the division using: $x / K \approx (x \cdot M) \gg n$
    - $M = \lfloor 2^n / K \rfloor$ ‚Äì Precomputed multiplier 
    - $n$ ‚Äì Bit shift amount, typically $n = 32$ or $64$ 

    ```python
    function divide_by_K(x, K):
        n = 32
        M = floor(2^n / K)  # Precompute multiplier
        bias = 2^(n - 1)  # Rounding correction
        
        if x < 0:
            return (x * M - bias) >> n  # Apply bias for negative values
        else:
            return (x * M + bias) >> n
    ```

## Modular Arithmetic in Computers
- **Integer arithmetic** operates under the rules of **modular arithmetic** 
  - because integers are stored in a `finite number of bits`
- This limitation forces results to **wrap around** when they exceed the representable range.
- Two integers $a$ and $b$ are said to be **congruent modulo $n$**, i.e. $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$, if:
  - The difference $a - b$ is divisible by $n$, i.e. 
    - $a - b = k \cdot n \quad \text{for some integer } k$
- Properties of Modular Arithmetic  

| **Operation** | **Formula**|
|----|----|
| **Addition**  | $(a + b) \bmod n = ((a \bmod n) + (b \bmod n)) \bmod n$   |
| **Subtraction**    | $(a - b) \bmod n = ((a \bmod n) - (b \bmod n)) \bmod n$   |
| **Multiplication** | $(a \cdot b) \bmod n = ((a \bmod n) \cdot (b \bmod n)) \bmod n$|
| **Exponentiation** | $a^k \bmod n = \left((a \bmod n)^k\right) \bmod n$  |
| **Division (Inverse)** | $b^{-1}$ exists if $b \cdot b^{-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ (if inverse exists) |
