# Representing and Manipulating Information

## Information Storage
- Computers access memory in **bytes (8 bits)** rather than individual bits, 
  - with each byte identified by a unique **address** in virtual memory.  
- **Virtual address space** is a conceptual view presented to programs, 
  - created by combining DRAM, flash memory, disk storage, hardware, and OS software.  
- Memory is partitioned by the compiler and runtime system 
  - to store **program data, instructions, and control information** within the virtual address space.  
- Pointers in C represent the **virtual address of a memory block**, 
  - with type information managed by the compiler, 
  - while machine-level code views all data as byte sequences.

## Hexadecimal Notation
- A byte (8 bits) ranges from **0 to 255 (decimal)** or **00 to FF (hexadecimal)**, 
  - with hex providing a concise way to represent bit patterns.  
- In C, **hexadecimal numbers** start with `0x` or `0X` and can use uppercase or lowercase 
  - e.g., `0xFA1D37B` or `0xfa1d37b`.  
- Converting between **binary and hex** is simple, done digit by digit, 
  - often using charts or memorized values for key hex digits.
- üìù Find the mappings between binary, octal, decimal, and hex
  ```python
  # Print table headers
  print(f"{'Decimal':<10}{'Binary':<10}{'Octal':<10}{'Hexadecimal':<10}")
  print("-" * 40)

  # Print values from 0 to 15
  for i in range(16):
      print(f"{i:<10}{bin(i)[2:].zfill(4):<10}{oct(i)[2:]:<10}{hex(i)[2:].upper():<10}")
  ```

## The Mappings Between Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hex

| Decimal  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12| 13| 14| 15|
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Binary| 0000 | 0001 | 0010 | 0011 | 0100 | 0101 | 0110 | 0111 | 1000 | 1001 | 1010 | 1011 | 1100 | 1101 | 1110 | 1111 |
| Octal | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 10| 11| 12| 13| 14| 15| 16| 17|
| Hex   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F |

## Data Sizes
- Word size determines the maximum virtual address space, 
  - 32-bit machines having a 4GB limit 
  - 64-bit machines supporting up to 16 exabytes.
- 64-bit machines can run both 32-bit and 64-bit programs, 
  - depending on how the program is compiled.
- C language supports multiple data formats and sizes for integers and floating-point types, 
  - integer types available in signed and unsigned variants.
- Programmers should use fixed-size types like `int32_t` and `int64_t` for portability, 
  - ensure programs handle differences in data type sizes across platforms.

## Example Data Representations

| Data Type | char | short | int | long | float | double | long double | pointer |
|----|------|-------|-----|------|-------|-----|----|-----|
| Typical 32-bit| 1| 2 | 4   | 4| 4 | 8  | ‚àí   | 4   |
| Typical 64-bit| 1| 2 | 4   | 8| 4 | 8  | ‚àí   | 8   |
| x86-64| 1| 2 | 4   | 8| 4 | 8  | 10/16  | 8   |

## Addressing and Byte Ordering

- Multi-byte objects have a memory address given by the `smallest byte's address`  with bytes stored contiguously in two byte ordering
  - `little-endian` (`least` significant byte first), typically used by Intel-compatible machines
  - `big-endian` (`most` significant byte first), typically used by IBM/Oracle machines
  - some processors are bi-endian, such as ARM

- `0x12345678` memory layout

| Address      | 0x100 | 0x101 | 0x102 | 0x103 |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Little-Endian| 0x78  | 0x56  | 0x34  | 0x12  |
| Big-Endian   | 0x12  | 0x34  | 0x56  | 0x78  |


- Byte ordering is crucial in 
  - low-level programming for data transfer between machines with different endianness, 
  - integer representation in machine-level code

---

## üìù Practice: Endianness Conversion
- ‚ûä In Python
  ```python
  import struct
  import binascii

  little_endian = struct.pack('<I', 0x12345678)
  big_endian = struct.pack('>I', 0x12345678)
  hex_little = binascii.hexlify(little_endian).decode()
  hex_big = binascii.hexlify(big_endian).decode()
  print(f'big_endian:{hex_big}, little_endian:{hex_little}')
  ```

- ‚ûã In C, [showmem.c](./code/showmem.c)
  ```bash
  # compile the source code
  gcc showmem -o showmem

  # show typical types
  ./showmem  21930 short
  ./showmem  305419896 int
  ./showmem 1311768465155175236 "long long"
  ./showmem 0x1122334455667788 pointer

  ./showmem 3.14 float
  ./showmem 3.14 double
  ./showmem 3.14 "long double"
  ```

## Representing Text
- Strings in C are arrays of characters terminated by a null byte (0), 
  - typically encoded in ASCII, 
  - ensuring platform independence for text data,
  - limited for encoding non-Latin scripts. 
- Unicode, with over 100,000 characters, provides a comprehensive standard supporting global languages.  
  - includes ancient scripts but rejected fictional scripts like Klingon from Star Trek.  
- UTF-8 encoding allows compatibility with ASCII, 
  - using 1 byte for common characters and more for rarer ones, 
  - ensuring efficient text representation.

## Unicode Encoding
| Encoding  | Description  | Byte Length<br>per character  | Compatibility| Use Case |
|---|---|------|---|----|
| **UTF-8** | Variable-length encoding    | 1 to 4 bytes      | Backward compatible with ASCII | Web, text files, most common encoding     |
| **UTF-16**| Variable-length encoding    | 2 or 4 bytes | Compatible with UCS-2| Windows, Java, used for internal processing|
| **UTF-32**| Fixed-length encoding       | 4 bytes | Direct mapping to Unicode code points  | Rare, used in specialized applications    |
