Optimizing example
---

1. **Benchmarking Setup**
- Uses a vector data structure with type-flexible operations (sum/product via `IDENT`/`OP` macros)
- CPE measured on Intel Core i7 for integer/floating-point variants, revealing initial performance baselines (~23 CPE sum, ~20 CPE product)

2. **Optimization Process**
- Iterative approach: transform code → measure CPE → analyze assembly bottlenecks
- Even basic compiler optimizations (`-O1`) double performance without code changes

3. **Key Findings**
- Bounds checking adds safety overhead but slows execution
- 32/64-bit integers and float/double types show nearly identical performance (except division ops)
- Some transformations yield minor gains while others are game-changers

4. **Practical Insights**
- Always enable compiler optimizations (`-O1`/`-O2`) for immediate gains
- Measurement noise exists (small CPE variations) but trends remain clear
- Balance empirical testing with low-level analysis for best results

The core takeaway: Systematic benchmarking and stepwise optimization, guided by CPE metrics, reliably improves performance while compiler flags provide easy initial wins.
